Launch multiple parallel Opus 4.5 agents to thoroughly explore: $ARGUMENTS

Create 3-4 specialized agents focusing on different aspects:
1. Code structure and architecture
2. Implementation patterns and examples
3. Related files and dependencies
4. Documentation and comments

IMPORTANT: All agents MUST use model: "opus" - no exceptions.

Synthesize findings into a comprehensive answer.
